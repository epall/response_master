h1. Response Master

h2. Description

Many systems can be represented using transfer functions in the Laplace domain.
This Laplace form can be written as an equation, but it can also be shown
graphically using a pole-zero plot. Response Master seeks to provide an
interactive pole-zero plot that allows students to explore how it maps to
system response.

h2. Future

Eventually, Response Master should provide a Bode plot and an equation of the
function in real-time as the pole-zero plot is modified.
